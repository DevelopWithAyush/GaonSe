                        Playfair Display is very click-friendly when it is italicized. This serif font has beautiful curves and well-rounded corners, making it suitable for both traditional, as well as modern websites. It makes an excellent font for titles and headlines but doesnâ€™t work as well for long stretches of body copy, because it is less readable when used at smaller sizes.</p>

                        Cinzel is a typeface inspired by first-century Roman inscriptions and based on classical proportions. However, its thin lines also lend it a contemporary, bold feel making it a good choice for headlines, especially when paired with Raleway.
